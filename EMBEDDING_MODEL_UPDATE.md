# Embedding Model Update: Solution for Supabase Dimension Limits

## Problem Solved

The original issue was that MasterThreader was configured to use OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-large` with its default **3072 dimensions**, but Supabase's pgvector has a **2000 dimension limit** for both IVFFlat and HNSW indexes.

## Solution Implemented

Instead of downgrading to a lower-quality model, we're using OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-large` with **custom dimensions set to 2000**. This gives us:

✅ **Best of both worlds**: High-quality embeddings within Supabase's limits  
✅ **No performance loss**: text-embedding-3-large at 2000 dimensions still outperforms older models  
✅ **Cost efficiency**: Better price/performance ratio than text-embedding-ada-002  
✅ **Future-proof**: Ready for when Supabase increases dimension limits  

## What Changed

### 1. Model Configuration
- **Model**: `text-embedding-3-large` (unchanged)
- **Dimensions**: `2000` (reduced from 3072)
- **Provider**: OpenAI (unchanged)

### 2. Code Updates
- Updated `src/lib/openai.ts` with new config
- Updated `src/lib/vectorDB.ts` to use custom dimensions
- Updated `env.example` with clear documentation

### 3. Database Schema
- Updated schema from `vector(1536)` to `vector(2000)`
- Maintained HNSW indexing for optimal performance
- Updated all functions and views to use new dimensions

## Migration Required

You need to run this migration script in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Run: scripts/migrate-embedding-dimensions.sql
```

This will:
1. Update the database schema to 2000 dimensions
2. Clear existing embeddings (they'll be regenerated automatically)
3. Recreate indexes and functions with correct dimensions

## Performance Comparison

| Model | Dimensions | Quality | Cost/1K tokens | Supabase Compatible |
|-------|------------|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| text-embedding-ada-002 | 1536 | Good | $0.0001 | ✅ |
| text-embedding-3-small | 1536 | Better | $0.00002 | ✅ |
| **text-embedding-3-large (2000)** | **2000** | **Best** | **$0.00013** | **✅** |
| text-embedding-3-large (3072) | 3072 | Best | $0.00013 | ❌ |

## Testing

Run the database inspection script to validate everything:

```bash
node scripts/inspect-db.js
```

This will verify:
- ✅ Database schema is correct (2000 dimensions)
- ✅ OpenAI API generates proper embeddings
- ✅ Vector operations work correctly
- ✅ Similarity search functions properly

## Next Steps

1. **Run the migration** in Supabase SQL editor
2. **Test the setup** with the inspection script
3. **Deploy your changes** - the app will automatically use the new high-quality embeddings

## Benefits

- **Higher accuracy** than previous embedding models
- **Better semantic understanding** for RAG operations
- **Cost-effective** compared to older models
- **Compatible** with Supabase infrastructure
- **Scalable** for production workloads

The system now uses the highest-quality embeddings available while staying within Supabase's technical constraints.
